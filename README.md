I'm a begginer in IT but I have a good professional background behind me.
Almost 6 years in marketing gave me:

✅ Strong analitical skills. My favourite part of work was to analise audience, competitors and market in the whole.

✅ Project management skills. Working in collaboration with Marketing Agencies or different companies like a freelancer I was responsibile for product realese. One of the example of my work is https://gresco.com.ua/. In this project I:
- analysed audience, competitors and market;
- created content and made a moquap of the future web-site;
- created requirements for designer and developer;
- communicated with client in all stages of development;
- tested ready-made product;

✅ The ability to work on my own with minimum supervision.

✅ Basic testing experience.

The most interesting cases was when I worked in questrooms market place and we started new direction in quarantined period - online-quests.
- This is our web-application with online-quests: https://questgames.qeng.org/
- This is free and not confidential corporative online-quest: https://viyar.qeng.org/.

It was a great challenge to develope a new product in one month with team less than 10 persons.
