I'm a begginer in IT but I have a good professional background behind me.
Almost 6 years in marketing gave me:

✅ Strong analitical skills. My favourite part of work was to analise audience, competitors and market in the whole.

✅ Project managmant skills. Working in collaboration with Marketing Agencies or different companies like a freelancer I was responsibile for product realese. One of the example of my work is https://gresco.com.ua/. In this project I:
- analysed audience, competitors and market;
- created content and made a moquap of the future web-site;
- created requirements for designer and developer;
- communicated with client in all stages of development;
- tested ready-made product;

✅ The ability to work on my own with minimum supervision.

✅ Basic testing experience such as I was responsibile for product quality.
