I'm a beginner in IT but I have a good professional background behind me.
Almost 6 years in marketing gave me:

✅ Strong analitical skills. My favourite part of work was to analise audience, competitors and market in the whole.

✅ Project management skills. Working in collaboration with Marketing Agencies or different companies like a freelancer I was responsible for product release. One of the example of my work is https://gresco.com.ua/. In this project I:
- analysed audience, competitors and market;
- created content and made a mockup of the future web-site;
- created requirements for designer and developer;
- communicated with client in all stages of development;
- tested ready-made product;

✅ The ability to work on my own with minimum supervision.

✅ Basic testing experience.

The most interesting cases was when I worked in escape rooms market place and we started new direction in quarantined period - online escape games.
- This is our web-application with online games: https://questgames.qeng.org/

It was a really great challenge to develope a new product in one month with team less than 10 persons.
